# **Competence Over Compliance: Why RegTech Is Quietly Adding Negative Value to Society**

Regulation exists for good reasons — safety, privacy, environmental protection, consumer trust. But somewhere along the way, we started confusing **competence** with **compliance**, and mistaking green dashboards for actual capability.

That confusion has created one of the fastest-growing sectors in tech: RegTech.

The pitch is familiar:

> “Don’t worry about interpreting the rules.  
Our platform will keep you compliant.”

Helpful in theory. Risky in practice.  
Because when organisations *outsource thinking*, they don’t just save time — they slowly lose competence.

## **The Hidden Cost of Outsourcing Understanding**

Whether it’s a SaaS tool that tracks licences and renewal deadlines, a privacy wizard that spits out GDPR policies, or an ISO 27001/SOC 2 documentation suite, the pattern is the same:

**The organisation stops learning.**  
People stop understanding *why* a rule exists.  
Teams operate by checklist rather than by judgement.

From cybersecurity to workplace safety, from AML/KYC to food safety, from export controls to ESG reporting, we’re seeing an explosion of tools that make businesses *look compliant* without making them *more competent*.

That’s a dangerous tradeoff.

## **The Negative-Value Compliance Loop**

A quiet feedback loop is forming:

1. **Regulators demand more evidence.**  
2. Businesses respond with more documentation — often auto-generated.  
3. Regulators raise the standards again to validate that documentation.  
4. RegTech vendors grow by solving the problems created in step 3.

It becomes a self-reinforcing system where **the paperwork economy grows while real capability shrinks**.

We’ve all seen it:

- immaculate SOC 2 reports alongside preventable breaches  
- perfect WHS apps coexisting with poor on-site safety culture  
- automated AML screens that miss obvious behavioural red flags  
- ESG dashboards that optimise metrics instead of actual sustainability  

Compliance becomes a performance.  
Competence becomes optional.

## **Compliance Is the Floor — Not the Ceiling**

The problem isn’t regulation.  
It’s the belief that tools can *replace* comprehension.

A restaurant can have flawless digital temperature logs but still mishandle food.  
A construction firm can upload every certificate yet operate an unsafe site.  
A fintech can pass every AML check and still onboard a bad actor.

**Documentation isn’t safety.  
A dashboard isn’t strategy.  
Compliance isn’t competence.**

When organisations treat compliance as the goal rather than the minimum baseline, fragility rises — and society pays the cost.

## **RegTech Should Amplify Humans, Not Replace Them**

RegTech *can* be positive-sum.  
But only when it **supports** human judgement rather than substituting for it.

Great RegTech:

- simplifies complexity  
- reduces busywork  
- improves visibility  
- centralises knowledge  
- reinforces learning  
- highlights blind spots  

Bad RegTech:

- creates false certainty  
- hides underlying risks  
- encourages box-ticking  
- erodes internal capability  
- shifts culture from “we understand” to “the tool told us we’re fine”  

The real question every organisation should ask is simple:

> **Does this tool make us more competent,  
or just more compliant?**

## **A Competence-First Future**

The winners of the next decade won’t be the ones with the most certificates or the richest compliance stack. They’ll be the ones who rebuild internal capability — using RegTech as a multiplier, not a crutch.

Competence creates value.  
Compliance only records it.
