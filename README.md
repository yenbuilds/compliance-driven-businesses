# **Competence Over Compliance: Why RegTech Is Quietly Adding Negative Value to Society**

Regulation exists for good reasons — safety, privacy, environmental protection, consumer trust. But at some point we started confusing **competence** with **compliance**, and mistaking green dashboards for actual capability.

That confusion has created one of the fastest-growing sectors in tech: RegTech.

The pitch is familiar:

> “Don’t worry about interpreting the rules.  
Our platform will keep you compliant.”

Helpful in theory. Risky in practice.  
Because when organisations *outsource thinking*, they don’t just save time — they slowly lose competence.

## **The Hidden Cost of Outsourcing Understanding**

Whether it’s a SaaS tool that tracks licences and renewal deadlines, a privacy wizard that spits out GDPR policies, or an ISO 27001/SOC 2 documentation suite, the pattern is the same:

**The organisation stops learning.**  
People stop understanding *why* a rule exists.  
Teams operate by checklist rather than by judgement.

From cybersecurity to workplace safety, from AML/KYC to food safety, from export controls to ESG reporting, we’re seeing an explosion of tools that make businesses *look compliant* without making them *more competent*.

That’s a dangerous tradeoff.

## **The Negative-Value Compliance Loop**

A quiet feedback loop is forming:

1. **Regulators demand more evidence.**  
2. Businesses respond with more documentation — often auto-generated.  
3. Regulators raise the standards again to validate that documentation.  
4. RegTech vendors grow by solving the problems created in step 3.

It becomes a self-reinforcing system where **the paperwork economy grows while real capability shrinks**.

We’ve all seen it:

- immaculate SOC 2 reports alongside preventable breaches  
- perfect WHS apps coexisting with poor on-site safety culture  
- automated AML screens that miss obvious behavioural red flags  
- ESG dashboards that optimise metrics instead of actual sustainability  

Compliance becomes a performance.  
Competence becomes optional.

## **How Compliance Can Stifle Innovation and Slow Safety Progress**

There's a deeper paradox that few discuss:

**Compliance frameworks, designed to protect safety, can paradoxically slow the development of future safety improvements.**

The aviation industry offers a stark example. Modern airliners could benefit from cutting-edge technologies:

- **AI-powered predictive maintenance systems** that detect microscopic structural issues before they become critical
- **Advanced collision-avoidance using machine learning** that processes real-time data from multiple sources
- **Automated emergency response systems** leveraging modern sensors and computing power
- **Next-generation materials** developed through computational modelling and nanotechnology
- **Augmented reality cockpit systems** that improve pilot situational awareness

But here's the problem: introducing these innovations requires navigating certification frameworks designed for yesterday's technology.

The regulatory approval process for new aviation safety features can take 5-10 years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Certification requirements were written for mechanical systems, hydraulics, and analog instruments — not neural networks, quantum sensors, or distributed AI systems.

This creates a cruel irony:

- **Innovation freezes at the point of last certification.** Airlines continue using 40-year-old avionic architectures because they're "proven safe" — meaning they've been certified.
- **Safer technology stays grounded.** A new collision-avoidance system might be demonstrably superior in testing, but can't be deployed until it navigates a regulatory maze designed for different technology.
- **The compliance cost becomes a moat.** Only massive aerospace corporations can afford multi-year, multi-million-dollar certification processes, shutting out innovative startups with breakthrough safety ideas.
- **Risk aversion compounds.** Regulators, understandably cautious, demand ever-more evidence for new approaches while grandfathering in legacy systems with known limitations.

The same pattern repeats across industries:

- Medical devices that could save lives wait years for approval
- Building materials with superior fire resistance can't replace certified legacy materials
- Autonomous vehicle safety systems face regulatory frameworks designed for human drivers
- New pharmaceutical manufacturing processes remain unadopted despite being safer and more reliable

**The result:** We end up with a compliance regime that's simultaneously too strict for innovation and too lenient for legacy risks.

We optimise for *documented safety of known approaches* rather than *actual safety through continuous improvement*.

This isn't an argument against safety regulation — it's an argument that static compliance frameworks can't keep pace with exponential technological change. When the cost and time of regulatory approval exceeds the innovation cycle of the underlying technology, compliance itself becomes a barrier to the very safety it's meant to ensure.

## **Compliance Is the Floor — Not the Ceiling**

The problem isn’t regulation.  
It’s the belief that tools can *replace* comprehension.

A restaurant can have flawless digital temperature logs but still mishandle food.  
A construction firm can upload every certificate yet operate an unsafe site.  
A fintech can pass every AML check and still onboard a bad actor.

**Documentation isn’t safety.  
A dashboard isn’t strategy.  
Compliance isn’t competence.**

When organisations treat compliance as the goal rather than the minimum baseline, fragility rises — and society pays the cost.

## **RegTech Should Amplify Humans, Not Replace Them**

RegTech *can* be positive-sum.  
But only when it **supports** human judgement rather than substituting for it.

Great RegTech:

- simplifies complexity  
- reduces busywork  
- improves visibility  
- centralises knowledge  
- reinforces learning  
- highlights blind spots  

Bad RegTech:

- creates false certainty  
- hides underlying risks  
- encourages box-ticking  
- erodes internal capability  
- shifts culture from “we understand” to “the tool told us we’re fine”  

The real question every organisation should ask is simple:

> **Does this tool make us more competent,  
or just more compliant?**

## **A Competence-First Future**

The winners of the next decade won’t be the ones with the most certificates or the richest compliance stack. They’ll be the ones who rebuild internal capability — using RegTech as a multiplier, not a crutch.

Competence creates value.  
Compliance only records it.
